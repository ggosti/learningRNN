# learningRNN

Implementation of a discrete-time recurrent neural network with binary neurons
which learns to predict the behavior of a role-model neural network
with the backpropagation through time (BPTT) method.
In principle this learning neural network can be trained to predict any binary discrete-time dynamical system.
